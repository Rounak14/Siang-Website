        <h1>Places to see</h1><br>
	
        There are a number of famous tourist attraction in and around the city of Guwahati. Here's a list of a few:<br><br>
        <h2> Near Guwahati</h2><br>
        <ul>
        <h3>Kamakhya Temple -</h3>
        The Nilachal Hill situated at a distance of 7 km from Guwahati is of great historical, archeological as well as religious importance. This hill believed to be a 'Khasi' sacrificial site earlier, now has a group of ancient temples on the top; the largely eminent of them is the Kamakhya temple. The temple of Goddess Shakti or Kamakshya is the oldest and most revered centre for Shakti worship leading to the spread of the sect Tantrik Hinduism. <p>It is believed that female genitalia (yoni) of dead Sati fell down while her corpse was being carried by her husband Shiva turning the hill blue, therefore the name Neelachal (Blue Spread). This 10th century temple was reconstructed after being destroyed by Muslim rulers.
        <br><br>        
        <h3>Kaziranga National Park - </h3>
        The famous Kaziranga National Park, located at a distance of 200 km from Guwahati, is the star attraction for tourists for its unique animal and bird mix and authentic habitat in which the tourists are permitted to catch a gh3mpse. <p>The park is spread over an area of 450 sq km and has the blessings of river Brahmaputra throughout the stretch. This World Heritage Site is renowned for breeding and habituating the one-horned rhino. The park also boasts of a rich assortment of shallow water fowls, pond herons, fishing eagles, the egrets, river terns, adjutant and the black necked storks etc.<p> What a sight it is to ride a tall elephant and still be covered with grass which grows taller than the elephants and watch the rhinos steer expertly away from the trained Pachyderm. <br><br>
        <h3>Manas National Park -</h3>
        One of the most bravura National Park of India, the Manas National Park is situated 180 km from Guwahati. The Park rests at the foothills of the Himalayas and is spread over an area of 390 sq km. The park is replete with breeding grounds as well as the playgrounds of Tigers, Langurs, Water Buffaloes, Rhinos, Assamese Macaque and Hoolock Gibbon. <p>The verdant forest cover and marshy shades also provide an opportunity for the Avian Kingdom species to create a zone for themselves. It is possible to watch the giant hornbills (pied and gray), jungle fowl, scarlet minivet, etc. 
		<br><br>
        
        <h3>Tawang -</h3>
        Tawang at first look appears as a typical town on the Himalayan ranges. A close look however reveals the friendly and warm people and the amazing beauty and natural wonder it has to offer. This small town has a city center and the Tawang Monastery of the Gelugpa sect built by the Mera Lama in 1681. This is one of the largest Monasteries in India. <p>Located approximately 550 km from Guwahati, Tawang requires special Inner Area permit available at Kolkata or Guwahati. The travel to Tawang is full of beautiful stretches of lush green sloping valleys and verdant forest covered mountain peaks. The journey becomes more interesting after crossing the Sela Pass wherein one can halt and sample local meat/vegetable momos and cream buns. 
        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Navagraha Temple -</h3>
        From the Planetarium explaining the planets to the nine temples devoted to these celestial bodies, Guwahati has it all. Situated on the hilltop of the Chitrasal Hill or popularly known as Navgraha Hill (the hill of Nine Planets).The nine are temples dedicated to Surya (Sun) Chandra(Moon), Chevaai/Mangal(Mars), Budhan (Mercury), Guru/Brihaspati (Jupiter), Shukra (Venus), Shani (Saturn), Rahu (Head of Demon Snake) and Ketu (Tail of Demon Snake). <p>Though the temples are dedicated to the Planets, enshrined in the temple are nine Shivlingas with a symbolic colour garment for every planet. The cluster of Navagraha temple was constructed in 1751. <p><a href="http://www.ignca.nic.in/asp/showbig.asp?projid=asgwt0060001">http://www.ignca.nic.in/asp/showbig.asp?projid=asgwt0060001</a>


		<br><br>
        
        <h3>Basistha Ashram -</h3>
        Vasishtha / Basistha, the learned sage, is credited with writing the Hindu epic of Vasishtha Ramayana (behind the scenes Ramayana). The fact that this epic has survived millenniums, has been translated into several languages and is still recited daily in majority households speaks volumes about the abilities and knowledge of the author. The sage is believed to have created the Ashram and later died here. A grave dedicated to the Sage can be seen at the Ashram. <p>Three mountain tributaries Sandhya, Lalita and Kanta flow nearby the Ashram and the picturesque surroundings and the belief of longevity after a holy dip in the three streams have enhanced the popularity of this religious place. 
It is located just 12 km from the railway station.
		<br><br>
        <h3>Bhubaneswari Temple -</h3>
        The Bhubaneshwari temple appears like a tiny spec from the city of Guwahati. This white shrine perched atop a hill adjacent to the city is a major draw amongst the religious pilgrims. The temple dedicated to Goddess Bhubaneshwari has a beautiful surrounding of lush green plantation and provides an equally magnificent vie of the city of Guwahati. <p>The enchanting view of the sunset on the Brahamputra River as viewed from the hill attracts many tourists. Though the temple is high upon a hill, it requires a 20 minutes walk from the Bus Stand below to reach the Bhubaneshwari temple. 
		<br><br>
        
        <h3>Uma Nanda Temple -</h3>        
The river Brahmaputra has the final say as far as the lifestyles and survival of the Assamese in general and Guwahati populace in particular are considered. However, even the great Brahmaputra has to make way for the Gods when they decide to invade the river's territory and build their abode smack in the middle of it. <p>The Shiva temple of Umananda is arrogantly perched on an island smack in the middle of the river Brahmaputra. The temple is located atop a mound of steep steps from the shore. Boat Ferries and motor launches leave for the temple from the Umananda Ghat, on the shore.
		<br><br>

        
        <h3>Pandu -</h3>
        The city of Guwahati has the unique distinction of being associated with both the epics of Hinduism - the Ramayana through Sage Vasishtha and the Mahabharata through Pandu. The Subarban town of Pandu is named after King Pandu (father of the famous five Pandavas). The Tila Hills in the town has temple dedicated to Pandu (the Pandunath temple). <p>It is believed that the Pandavas, during their exile phase lived here under the guise of Ganesha. Five Ganesha idols representing the five Pandava brothers are found here. The place also presents various other idols of which the incarnation of Lord Narsimha (Half man and Half Lion) is very touching.
        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Guwahati Planetarium -</h3>
        The mind grows exponentially and the thoughts travel faster than speed, still the two combined together are not able to comprehend the expanse of the Universe and the mysteries and questions thrown at us by the space surrounding us. The Guwahati Planetarium, located on MG Road is a sincere attempt to reach the young and scientifically inclined minds and provide them a glimpse of the available treasure trove assembled over centuries by the human explorers.
        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Assam State Museum</h3>
        The State Museum operated by the Assam government is located near Dighalipukhuri tank. The museum is extremely popular due to its amazing (envious is the right word) anthology of antiques right back to the prehistoric times. The collection boasts of some of the most authentic prehistoric sculptures, metal, ivory paintings, woodwork and costumes etc. <p>The museum was instituted in 1940 and has since made every effort to incorporate every aspect of the lifestyles of Assamese community. The reconstructed tribal huts where one can walk right through them and examine them are result of such efforts. The display of weaving and musical instruments is another step in right direction.
